    abstract = {Accurate and low-cost sleep measurement tools are needed in both clinical and epidemiological research. To this end, wearable accelerometers are widely used as they are both low in price and provide reasonably accurate estimates of movement. Techniques to classify sleep from the high-resolution accelerometer data primarily rely on heuristic algorithms. In this paper, we explore the potential of detecting sleep using Random forests. Models were trained using data from three different studies where 134 adult participants (70 with sleep disorder and 64 good healthy sleepers) wore an accelerometer on their wrist during a one-night polysomnography recording in the clinic. The Random forests were able to distinguish sleep-wake states with an F1 score of 73.93% on a previously unseen test set of 24 participants. Detecting when the accelerometer is not worn was also successful using machine learning (F1-score > 93.31%), and when combined with our sleep detection models on day-time data provide a sleep estimate that is correlated with self-reported habitual nap behaviour (r=.60). These Random forest models have been made open-source to aid further research. In line with literature, sleep stage classification turned out to be difficult using only accelerometer data.},

    abstract  = {This research introduces a novel high-accuracy time-series forecasting method, namely the Time Neural Network (TNN), which is based on a kernel filter and time attention mechanism. Taking into account the complex characteristics of time-series data, such as non-linearity, high dimensionality, and long-term dependence, the TNN model is designed and implemented. The key innovations of the TNN model lie in the incorporation of the time attention mechanism and kernel filter, allowing the model to allocate different weights to features at each time point, and extract high-level features from the time-series data, thereby improving the model's predictive accuracy. Additionally, an adaptive weight generator is integrated into the model, enabling the model to automatically adjust weights based on input features. Mainstream time-series forecasting models such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM) are employed as baseline models and comprehensive comparative experiments are conducted. The results indicate that the TNN model significantly outperforms the baseline models in both long-term and short-term prediction tasks. Specifically, the RMSE, MAE, and R2 reach 0.05, 0.23, and 0.95, respectively. Remarkably, even for complex time-series data that contain a large amount of noise, the TNN model still maintains a high prediction accuracy.},

    abstract = {Objective: This paper aims to report on the accuracy of estimating sleep stages using a wrist-worn device that measures movement using a 3D accelerometer and an optical pulse photoplethysmograph (PPG). Approach: Overnight recordings were obtained from 60 adult participants wearing these devices on their left and right wrist, simultaneously with a Type III home sleep testing device (Embletta MPR) which included EEG channels for sleep staging. The 60 participants were self-reported normal sleepers (36 M: 24 F, age  =  34  ±  10, BMI  =  28  ±  6). The Embletta recordings were scored for sleep stages using AASM guidelines and were used to develop and validate an automated sleep stage estimation algorithm, which labeled sleep stages as one of Wake, Light (N1 or N2), Deep (N3) and REM (REM). Features were extracted from the accelerometer and PPG sensors, which reflected movement, breathing and heart rate variability. Main results: Based on leave-one-out validation, the overall per-epoch accuracy of the automated algorithm was 69%, with a Cohen’s kappa of 0.52  ±  0.14. There was no observable bias to under- or over-estimate wake, light, or deep sleep durations. REM sleep duration was slightly over-estimated by the system. The most common misclassifications were light/REM and light/wake mislabeling. Significance: The results indicate that a reasonable degree of sleep staging accuracy can be achieved using a wrist-worn device, which may be of utility in longitudinal studies of sleep habits.}

Since signals are measurements taken during the time, the problem is seen as time-series data classification. Deep learning methods are chosen to solve the problem are convolutional neural network and long-short term memory network. Input data is structured as a time-series sequence of mentioned signals that represent 30 seconds epoch, which is a standard interval for sleep analysis. The records used belong to the overall 23 subjects, which are divided into two subsets. Records from 18 subjects were used for training the data and from 5 subjects for testing the data. For detecting four sleep stages: REM (Rapid Eye Movement), Wake, Light sleep (Stage 1 and Stage 2), and Deep sleep (Stage 3 and Stage 4), the accuracy of the model is 55%, and F1 score is 44%. For five stages: REM, Stage 1, Stage 2, Deep sleep (Stage 3 and 4), and Wake, the model gives an accuracy of 40% and F1 score of 37%.}

abstract = {Background and objectives
The classification of sleep stages is a preliminary exam that contributes to the diagnosis of possible sleep disorders. However, it is a tedious and time-consuming task when conducted manually by experts. Many studies explored ways of automating polysomnogram signals analysis. They are based on two main strategies: conventional machine learning and deep learning methods. The objective of this work is to carry out a comparative study on these two classes of models.
Method
A primary comparison of performance of these classifiers is carried out using eight conventional machine learning algorithms and a feed-forward neural networks to assess whether this latter method have definitely supplanted the first. As sleep epochs show inter-epochs correlation, a study of the distinctive influence of this temporal dependence on the classifiers performance is then conducted introducing for this purpose (uni- and bi-directional) long short-term memory networks. In a context of generalization of the use of wearable devices, a comparison of the classification methods examined is also carried out in their accuracy when dealing with a reduced number of channels. Finally, the robustness of the results obtained to the choice of features selection algorithms is discussed.
Results and conclusion
Our results show that support vector machine with radial basis function and random forest are just as valid for predicting sleep stages classification as feature-based neural networks with performance closed to the state of the art. This conclusion remains valid even after the introduction of inter-epochs temporal dependence, reduction of the number of channels or change in features selection method.}

  abstract = {Sleep arousals are transient periods of wakefulness punctuated into sleep. Excessive sleep arousals are associated with symptoms such as sympathetic activation, non-restorative sleep, and daytime sleepiness. Currently, sleep arousals are mainly annotated by human experts through looking at 30-second epochs (recorded pages) manually, which requires considerable time and effort. Here we present a deep learning approach for automatically segmenting sleep arousal regions based on polysomnographic recordings. Leveraging a specific architecture that ‘translates’ input polysomnographic signals to sleep arousal labels, this algorithm ranked first in the “You Snooze, You Win” PhysioNet Challenge. We created an augmentation strategy by randomly swapping similar physiological channels, which notably improved the prediction accuracy. Our algorithm enables fast and accurate delineation of sleep arousal events at the speed of 10 seconds per sleep recording. This computational tool would greatly empower the scoring process in clinical settings and accelerate studies on the impact of arousals.},
