  abstract = {Accurate and low-cost sleep measurement tools are needed in both clinical and epidemiological research. To this end, wearable accelerometers are widely used as they are both low in price and provide reasonably accurate estimates of movement. Techniques to classify sleep from the high-resolution accelerometer data primarily rely on heuristic algorithms. In this paper, we explore the potential of detecting sleep using Random forests. Models were trained using data from three different studies where 134 adult participants (70 with sleep disorder and 64 good healthy sleepers) wore an accelerometer on their wrist during a one-night polysomnography recording in the clinic. The Random forests were able to distinguish sleep-wake states with an F1 score of 73.93% on a previously unseen test set of 24 participants. Detecting when the accelerometer is not worn was also successful using machine learning (F1-score > 93.31%), and when combined with our sleep detection models on day-time data provide a sleep estimate that is correlated with self-reported habitual nap behaviour (r=.60). These Random forest models have been made open-source to aid further research. In line with literature, sleep stage classification turned out to be difficult using only accelerometer data.},

  abstract  = {This research introduces a novel high-accuracy time-series forecasting method, namely the Time Neural Network (TNN), which is based on a kernel filter and time attention mechanism. Taking into account the complex characteristics of time-series data, such as non-linearity, high dimensionality, and long-term dependence, the TNN model is designed and implemented. The key innovations of the TNN model lie in the incorporation of the time attention mechanism and kernel filter, allowing the model to allocate different weights to features at each time point, and extract high-level features from the time-series data, thereby improving the model's predictive accuracy. Additionally, an adaptive weight generator is integrated into the model, enabling the model to automatically adjust weights based on input features. Mainstream time-series forecasting models such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM) are employed as baseline models and comprehensive comparative experiments are conducted. The results indicate that the TNN model significantly outperforms the baseline models in both long-term and short-term prediction tasks. Specifically, the RMSE, MAE, and R2 reach 0.05, 0.23, and 0.95, respectively. Remarkably, even for complex time-series data that contain a large amount of noise, the TNN model still maintains a high prediction accuracy.},
