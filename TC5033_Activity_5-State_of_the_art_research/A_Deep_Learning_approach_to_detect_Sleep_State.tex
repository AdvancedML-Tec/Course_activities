\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% Some Computer Society conferences also require the compsoc mode option,
% but others use the standard conference format.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction}

This paper presents a project proposal rooted in the practical application of a Kaggle competition, aimed at addressing a challenge in pediatric health and neuroscience: the identification of sleep states in children through wrist-worn accelerometer data. The competition serves as a catalyst for innovation, prompting the development of a sophisticated machine learning model capable of discerning the subtle onset of various sleep states and periods of wakefulness with precision.

The significance of this project lies in its potential to deepen our understanding of sleep and to provide further insights into its importance. For instance, understanding how environmental factors influence sleep, mood, and behavior can aid in formulating personalized strategies tailored to the unique needs of each child \cite{child-mind-institute-detect-sleep-states}. Furthermore, the outcomes of this project could enable researchers to undertake more comprehensive, large-scale sleep studies across a variety of populations and contexts, which could yield even more valuable information about sleep \cite{child-mind-institute-detect-sleep-states}.


\section{Literature Review}

For this type of problem, a Machine Learning approach based on Random Forest has proven effective in detecting sleep-wake states, nonwear versus wear, and sleep stage classification \cite{Sundararajan2021}. An initial attempt was made using a Residual Neural Network (RNN), specifically a ResNet initialized with a Glorot uniform initializer and employing LeakyReLU activations \cite{Sundararajan2021}. However, when testing this approach with the Amsterdam dataset, which consists of data collected from 114 individuals recruited by the VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam, The Netherlands \cite{teLindert2020}, it was observed that the Random Forest approach outperformed the ResNet heuristic. Notably, the ResNet had difficulties with wake state prediction \cite{Sundararajan2021}. 

It is important to note that the analyzed information for sleep state detection can come from different types of devices, from example from an optical plethysmography and accelerometer signals \cite{Beattie_2017} \cite{Fedorin2019}, depending on the research. Specifically, there are cases in which the data is extracted from accelerometers among other types of sensors. Therefore, the methods utilized in each case serve as a baseline for their respective projects, this means that couldn't be possible a suitable that generalize over the data coming from different sources.


\section{Future Directions}

The ultimate goal is to apply a developed Deep Learning architecture to the dataset provided by \cite{child-mind-institute-detect-sleep-states}. Our primary motivation lies in the use of deep learning methods for time series analysis, particularly with the "Detect Sleep States" dataset furnished by the Child Mind Institute \cite{child-mind-institute-detect-sleep-states}, which consists of approximately 500 multi-day recordings from wrist-mounted accelerometers. The accelerometer data in the dataset was processed using R with the GGIR package \cite{Migueles2019GGIR}. The recordings are labeled with two event types: 'onset', indicating the start of sleep, and 'wakeup', marking its end. The primary objective is to identify these two events within the accelerometer data series.


\subsection{Exploratory Data Analysis}

We are planning to start with Exploratory Data Analysis of the dataset % TODO


\subsection{Model Evaluation}

For model evaluation as required by the competition, it is required to compute the average precision. By collecting the events within each \texttt{series\_id} from the data the Average Precision score will be computed for each \( \text{event} \times \text{tolerance} \) group \cite{child-mind-institute-detect-sleep-states}. The Average Precision is a measure that combines recall and precision for ranked retrieval results, for one information need, the average precision is the mean of the precision scores after each relevant document is retrieved \cite{Zhang2009}.

\begin{equation*}
\text{Average Precision} = \frac{\sum\nolimits_{r}P @ r}{R},
\end{equation*}

Where \( r \) is the rank of each relevant document, \( R \) is the total number of relevant documents, and \( P@r \) is the precision of the top-\textit{r} retrieved documents.

In this evaluation, predictions that align with the ground-truth and exceed the threshold are labeled as TP. Predictions that don't match are labeled as FP, while ground-truths without a corresponding prediction are labeled as FN.

\[
\text{Score}(x) = 
\begin{cases} 
\text{TP} & \text{if }x \text{ matched and } x > \text{thresh.} \\
\text{FP} & \text{if }x \text{ unmatched pred.} \\
\text{FN} & \text{if }x \text{ unmatched truth} \\
\text{TN} & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]


\section{Conclusion}

To address this challenge, we want to continue over implementing deep learning techniques, despite evidence from \cite{Sundararajan2021} indicating that traditional methods such as Random Forest outperform ResNets. Our motivation stems from the insights gained from \cite{Zhang2023}, where the authors present the Time-Series Neural Network (TNN). This method, which incorporates a Kernel Filter alongside a Time Attention Mechanism \cite{Zhang2023}, has demonstrated high accuracy in forecasting. In our specific context, we are in the process of evaluating whether Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM), Graph Neural Networks (GNN), or potentially an attention-based mechanism would be most suitable for our application.
